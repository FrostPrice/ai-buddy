# AI Buddy

Rust implementation of an AI using the OpenAI (Should be ClosedAI) API.

## Require

- [Rust Stable](https://rustup.rs)

## How to run

### Starting dev environment

- There are 2 ways that this can be achieved:

  - Using `cargo build` and `cargo run` in sequence
  - **(Recomended)** using `cargo watch` to enable live reload of the APP and on development testing. Run the following: `cargo watch -q -c -x "run -q" for just the live-reload.
